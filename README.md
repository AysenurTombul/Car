This project is a Flask-based Car Rental Web Application. Users can search for cars, make reservations, and log in using their Google account.

Features:
User Authentication & Registration (Email/Password & Google OAuth)
Car Search & Filtering (Brand, Transmission, Price)
Reservation System (Office Selection, Date & Time Setup)
Google Maps Integration (Office Locations)
Admin Panel (Office & Car Management)

Technologies
Flask & Flask-Login
Flask-SQLAlchemy (SQLite Database)
Google OAuth & Google Maps API
Bootstrap 5 & Jinja2 Templates

The encountered problem is that the login and register functionalities are not storing data in the database
Any registration attempt does not persist user information in the database. Additionally, we were not able to fully set up the database.
